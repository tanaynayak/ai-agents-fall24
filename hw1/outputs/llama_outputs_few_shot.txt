Q: Why, in 2017, is Russia considered an enemy of the United States?

A: Imagine you and your best friend, Alex, used to share toys and have sleepovers. But one day, Alex started taking all your favorite toys without asking and wouldn't let you join in on their fun. You'd feel sad and mad, right?

That's kind of like what happened between the United States and Russia. A long time ago, they were friends and worked together on important things. But later, Russia started doing some things that made the US feel sad and mad.

One big thing was that Russia hacked into some of the US's computers and copied important information, like secrets. It's like Alex peeking at your diary without permission!

Another thing was that Russia got involved in some other countries' problems, like Ukraine, without asking the US. It's like Alex trying to take over your old playground without asking you or anyone else!

When the US felt hurt and upset, they started to see Russia as an "enemy" because Russia wasn't being a good friend or neighbor. It's like how you might stop playing with Alex because they're being mean or taking all your toys.

In 2017, the US and Russia were still having some big disagreements, and the US was concerned about Russia's actions. That's why Russia was considered an "enemy" in a way, but it doesn't mean the two countries will never be friends again. Maybe one day they'll find a way to share toys and have sleepovers again!

Question: Why is the latest Pepsi ad causing so much political outrage?
Generated Answer: Here's the answer:

Q: Why is the latest Pepsi ad causing so much political outrage?

A: So, Pepsi is a big company that makes yummy drinks and snacks. They want to be liked by lots of people, including grown-ups. They made a special ad with a model, Kendall Jenner, and some cool music. But, some people didn't like it because they thought it made light of big problems like racism and police brutality. They said the ad was only pretending to care about these problems, but it wasn't really doing anything to help.

Some people also thought the ad was trying to sell "coolness" by associating Pepsi with social justice causes, which they didn't trust. It's like if someone wore a superhero cape to a party, but didn't actually have any superpowers â€“ it might look funny, but it wouldn't be real.

When something like this happens, people get upset because they think the company is trying to manipulate them or make money off their feelings. It's like if someone took a toy away from you, and you didn't understand why â€“ you'd feel angry or confused.

So, lots of people shouted "Hey, Pepsi! You're not doing it right!" and the company listened. They didn't make the ad again, and they said sorry to everyone who got upset. That's what's happening!

Question: How are dogs able to return home after many years after running away/getting lost?
Generated Answer: Here's an ELI5-style answer to your question:

Q: How are dogs able to return home after many years after running away/getting lost?

A: Dogs have a special knack for finding their way back home, and it's not just because they're good at sniffing out treats! When dogs leave their homes, they often leave behind a special "scent trail" - like a map made of smells - that helps them navigate their way back. This scent trail is unique to each dog's family and home, and dogs can smell it even after a really long time.

Think of it like a strong aroma of cooking that you can still smell in your neighborhood even after you leave the bakery. Dogs have a super strong sense of smell, called olfactory, that's way better than humans. They can detect tiny whiffs of scents that are super faint to us.

When dogs are lost, they use this strong sense of smell to find their way back to their "smell map". They sniff around and follow the familiar scents, like the smell of their family members or the food they ate at home. It's like they're following a familiar trail of breadcrumbs!

Some dogs also have great spatial memory, which means they remember the layout of their neighborhood and home. They might not remember exactly what their home looks like, but they remember the streets, alleys, and landmarks around their home. It's like they have a mental map of their neighborhood!

So, when dogs go missing, they use a combination of their super sense of smell and their spatial memory to find their way back home, even after many years!

Question: Why is a bakers dozen 13 and not 12?
Generated Answer: Q: Why is a baker's dozen 13 and not 12?

A: A long, long time ago, people used to buy bread from bakers. If the bread wasn't fresh or was broken, the customers would get upset and even angry! 

To avoid getting in trouble, bakers would add an extra loaf of bread to the dozen (12) they sold. This extra loaf was like a "magic trick" to make the bread look better and show the customers they cared. The bakers called this extra loaf a "doubloon".

So, when we say a baker's dozen is 13, it means the baker added an extra loaf, or the "doubloon", to the original 12 loaves. This way, the bakers could guarantee the customers got a good deal and have yummy fresh bread!

That's why we still use 13 instead of 12 for a baker's dozen today. It's like a special tradition that shows the bakers care about their customers and want to make sure they're happy with their bread!

Generated Answer: Let me try to explain it to you in a way that's easy to understand!

Those Facebook pages with weird characters and double spacing in the name? They're like a secret club for sharing fun pictures and jokes!

You see, a long time ago, internet users wanted to create special names for their online spaces. They started using weird characters like "#", "!", and "$" to make their names stand out. It was like a game of "code" to remember which page was which!

Those weird characters are called "characters" or "symbols". They make the name look fancy and unique, like a superhero name!

The double spacing in the name is actually an abbreviation. It's called "emoticon" or "emoji" for short. It's a way to add a funny face or feeling to the name!
