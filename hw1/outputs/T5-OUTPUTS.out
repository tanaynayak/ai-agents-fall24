Answer Column: Enemy is the wrong word. Rather, they are an adversary. It's a key difference. While we agree on many things - and while the US is Russia's 5th largest trading partner - our countries have fundamental socio-political differences. Since the fall of the Soviet Union, Russia is attempting to somewhat recapture its former glory. It's difficult for the country to do this on a cultural/academic level due to significant braindrain. That is, Western nations can offer better quality of life for well-educated or skilled Russians. Therefore, the country flexes it's might diplomatically and militarily. They expand their borders and influence to show strength. This causes many Russian people to feel a newfound sense of Nationalism, this gives the government more power (and makes it less democratic), it gives Putin more control, while it threatens our NATO allies.. which hurts Russo-American relations. Meanwhile, it harms cultural and academic institutions within Russia that rely on freedoms and/funding - those folks are further incentivized to leave for greener/safer pastures. Which means Russia has to further advance their influence on the world via strength. Pretty soon - all that are left are indoctrinated Pro-Russian academics that refute Western values. Things are certainly better since the end of the Cold War - but we keep each other in check via economic interests rather than nuclear. This is why Russia plays nicer when we place sanctions.

Question: Why is the latest Pepsi ad causing so much political outrage?
Generated Answer: The ad is a shit. It's a shit. It's a shit.
Answer Column: Protestors and police have had a pretty volatile relationship. Looong history of protests becoming violent either through the protestors becoming rioters or through the police becoming violent... Or both! No no matter whose side you're on when looking at a protest, emotions can run pretty high. So for some people on both sides of the political spectrum, this ad is making light of something that people feel very strongly over. The ad carries an implication that the only thing standing between polarising views is a can of Pepsi. If you're on the side of the police, the ad implies that they need to lighten up with a refreshing carbonated beverage, when cops have been seriously injured or even died while doing their jobs. And if you're on the side of the protestors, the ad implies that we can overcome the social ills of the world (inequality between the sexes, racism, LGBT+ rights) if we sat with the oppressors and shared a can of Pepsi or two. Add to that the general venom surrounding anything a Kardashian-Jenner does, and you have yourself an internet shitstorm.

Answer Column: It comes from a medieval law regulating the price and weight of bread. Bakers would be penalised for selling under-weight loaves, so they would add a bit extra to be sure that customers received the weight they paid for. A customer who paid for a dozen loaves might receive a "baker's dozen" of 13 loaves, so the baker could be confident that he had supplied at least 12 loaves-worth of bread.
